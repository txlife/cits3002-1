====================================================================

Test certificates provided in client_certs/server_certs were sourced from the student help forum for 
CITS3002, these are not our own work and have been used for testing only.

Useage Examples
====================================================================
Server binary can be run from server directory, client binary from client directory.
		(Not a perfect edition)

Server usage: 

	./server

Client usage:
	-a filename (add file to trustcloud)

		./client -h 127.0.0.1:3490 -a bom.html

	-c number (provide circumference of ring of trust)
		(currently only implemented to be used alongside other flags, i.e. -f and -l)

	-f filename (fetch file filename from the server)

		./client -h 127.0.0.1:3490 -f bom.html [-c 3]

	-h hostname:port (specify hostname to connect on)
		NOTE: Current server implementation only uses 3490 port

		./client -h 127.0.0.1:3490

	-l 	(list all stored files and how they are protected)
		
		./client -h 127.0.0.1:3490 -l [-c 3]

	-u certificate (upload certificate)
		NOTE: client certificates should be stored in client_certs, alongside their key
			files with the format: 
				A_key.pem (private key)
				A_crt.pem (certificate)

		./client -h 127.0.0.1:3490 -u A 	(use only unique identifier part of the name)

	-v filename certificate (vouch for authenticity of existing file on trustserver using indicated cert)

		./client -h 127.0.0.1:3490 -v bom.html A	(again only use unique id of certificate)
