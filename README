====================================================================

Test certificates provided in client_certs/server_certs were sourced from the student help forum for 
CITS3002, these are not our own work and have been used for testing only.

Useage Examples
====================================================================
Server binary can be run from server directory, client binary from client directory.
		(Not a perfect edition)

Server usage: 

	./server

Client usage:
  -a filename 
  (add file to trustcloud)

  	./client -h 127.0.0.1:3490 -a bom.html

  -c number 
  (provide circumference of ring of trust)
    (currently only implemented to be used alongside 
      other flags, i.e. -f and -l)

  -f filename 
  (fetch file filename from the server)

  	./client -h 127.0.0.1:3490 -f bom.html [-c 3]

  -h hostname:port (specify hostname to connect on)
  	NOTE: Current server implementation only uses 3490 port

  	./client -h 127.0.0.1:3490

  -l 	
  (list all stored files and how they are protected)
  	
  	./client -h 127.0.0.1:3490 -l [-c 3]

  -u certificate (upload certificate)
  	NOTE: client certificates should be stored in 
            client_certs, alongside their key files with the format:

  			A_key.pem (private key)
  			A_crt.pem (certificate)

  	./client -h 127.0.0.1:3490 -u A 	
    (use only unique identifier part of the name)

  -v filename certificate 
  (vouch for authenticity of existing file on trustserver using indicated cert)

  	./client -h 127.0.0.1:3490 -v bom.html A	
    (again only use unique id of certificate)

CHANGE LOG
====================================================================

[22 May 2014] Adapted trustcloud.c to match protocol defined in 
							communicationProtocol.txt

    + All changes occur in send_header and unpack header. 
    + unpack_header now sends confirmation message (if it is not
    	unpacking a confirmation message already)
    + send_header waits for confirmation message before proceeding
    + This way we have the ability to communicate with server/client
      that does not match in implementation.
